listeners are nothing but interfaces

ITestListener - this is the interface

TestListenerAdapter - this is a class
--------------------------------------------------
you test something manually

you script your automation code

you write your test cases

you execute your test cases

you analyze the test results

3 outcomes of test cases - 
some will pass
some might fail - it will give you screenshot of the failure
some might skip

listeners are nothing but event triggers. They listen to the code, and accordingly pass their judgment
