public class Inheritance {

	// classes - parent, child/sub class
	// these concepts will work only if you design a parent and respective children
	// classes.
	// child class inherits some of the properties of the parent class
	// parent class does not inherit from the child class

	// object acquires properties/behavior of its parent object

	// advantages:-
	// code - reusability
	// we can use polymorphism

	// disadvantage - 2 classes are tightly coupled with each other

	// what you cannot inherit?
	// private method
	// constructor

	// single level, multi-level, hierarchical(not required in java)
}
